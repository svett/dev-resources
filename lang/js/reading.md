#### [Learning Essential JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) 
In my opinion this is the definitive book on effective JavaScript patterns. Specifically it focuses on object construction, how to identify appropriate patterns for different situations. Osmani is a great writer and he approaches the topic in a conversational manner, with great, practical examples. _-Nick_

#### [Introduction to Functional JavaScript](https://medium.com/functional-javascript/introduction-to-functional-javascript-45a9dca6c64a)
Functional programming is a powerful paradigm, one for which JavaScript is well-suited. This article touches on some of the history of the JavaScript language, the differences between the main programming paradigms, why functional programming is useful, and how to make the most of JavaScript as a multi-paradigm language. There is a follow-up by the same author, [Higher Order Functions](https://medium.com/functional-javascript/higher-order-functions-78084829fff4), which is also definitely worth checking out. _-Nick_

#### [Browserify Handbook](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook)
Browserify let's you use Node-style `require()` in your client-side code. Once you start writing awesome modular front-end code, with basically zero overhead, you'll wonder how you ever managed projects any other way. Browserify Handbook is a guide to using this awesome tool, written by it's creator. _-Nick_

#### [Optimization Killers](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers)
The V8 JavaScript engine is a masterpiece; it does an amazing job of optimizing code. However, there are some things that it can't optimize. This stuff is external to the time complexity of your code, so you can't really identify this stuff just by reading code. _-Nick_

#### [Human JavaScript](http://read.humanjavascript.com/)
Practical patterns for simple but powerful JavaScript apps. No magic frameworks. You're going to work with fundamental JavaScript in a way you'll understand, and with explanations that help you learn how to make great choices as you build your apps. _-Alex_
