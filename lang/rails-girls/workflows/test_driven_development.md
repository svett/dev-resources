# Test-Driven Development Workflow

1. Grab a user story
2. Create a failing cucumber feature (scenarios and steps) for the story
3. Create failing unit test for implementation
4. Write model implementation until unit tests pass
5. Refactor implementation and/or test code
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 until the given scenario is passing
7. Refactor feature scenario code from imperative to declarative
8. When all scenarios are passing, feature is complete!
