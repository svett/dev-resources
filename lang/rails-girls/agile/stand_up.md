# Daily Stand Ups

The motto is: short, sweet and focused.  Whether you are standing or not, a daily stand up meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.  We don't want to be too dogmatic about the length of time; however, be conscious of the time.

### Attendees

* Product Manager (if different from the Product Owner)
* All members of the development team

### Agenda

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles (blockers) are impeding my progress?
