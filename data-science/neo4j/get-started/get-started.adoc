== [.label]#Guide →# What is a Graph Database?
- - -
Connected information is everywhere in our world.
Neo4j was build to efficiently store, handle and query highly connected elements in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model you can represent your real-world, variably structured information without a loss of fidelity.
//At the same time you can choose to view your data from many different view-points and projections, only depending on your use-cases not a predefined structure.
The property graph model is easy to understand and handle, especially for object oriented and relational developers.

We wanted to make querying graph data not only fun, but easy to learn, understand and use for everyone.
That's why we created a human friendly, declarative query language for you which uses ASCII-Art to represent graph patterns to find or update.
