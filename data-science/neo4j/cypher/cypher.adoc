- - -
Cypher is Neo4j’s graph query language.
Cypher’s syntax provides a familiar way to match patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.
These developer guides and tutorials show you how to query Neo4j using Cypher.

Here is a simple example of a cypher query (cast of movies starting with "T")

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE movie.title =~ "T.*"
RETURN movie.title as title, collect(actor.name) as cast
ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 10;
