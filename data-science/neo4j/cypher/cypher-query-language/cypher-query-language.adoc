== About Cypher

Cypher is a declarative, SQL-inspired language for describing patterns in graphs.
It allows us to describe *what* we want to select, insert, update or delete from a graph database without requiring us to describe exactly *how* to do it.

=== Nodes

Cypher uses ASCII-Art to represent patterns.
We surround nodes with parentheses which look like circles, e.g. `(node)`.
If we later want to refer to the node, we'll give it an identifier like `(p)` for person or `(t)` for thing.
In real-world queries, we'll probably use longer, more expressive variable names like `(person)` or `(thing)`.

To illustrate, if we want to find all the *persons* and the *things* they like, the query will include the identifiers *person* and *thing*.
We might use a pattern like `+(person)-->(thing)+` so we can refer to them later, for example, to access properties like `person.name` and `thing.quality`.

The more general structure is:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node) RETURN node.property

MATCH (node1)-->(node2)
RETURN node2.propertyA, node2.propertyB
----

=== Relationships

The problem with the Cypher snippets we saw above is that they didn't say anything about the relationship between the nodes, so even though we used the identifier *person*, we may well have gotten back *suppliers* and *sellers* of our *things*.
So we need to be able to describe the types of relationships in our Cypher queries.

If we wanted to retrieve everyone who likes a thing, we would describe the pattern `+(person)-[:LIKE]->(thing)+` to retrieve only nodes that had a relationship typed *LIKE* with other nodes (*thing*).
Those nodes would then be *persons* as implied by the *LIKE* relationship.

Or generally:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node1)-[:REL_TYPE]->(node2)
----

Sometimes we need access to information about a relationship (e.g. its type or properties).
For example, we might want to output the *rating* that a *person* gave a *thing* and that *rating* would probably be a property of the *LIKE* relationship.
As with nodes, we can use identifiers for relationships (in front of the *:TYPE*).
If we tried to match `+(person)-[how:LIKE]->(thing)+`, we would be able to output the `how.rating` for each of the persons and all the things that they like.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node1)-[rel:TYPE]->(node2)
RETURN rel.property
----

=== Labels

Labels allow us to assign roles or types to our nodes.
For example, we might want to distinguish *things* from *persons* or *companies* (both deal with things).
By matching for `+(person:Person)-[:LIKE]->(thing)+`, it will return *John*, but not *ACME Inc*--a well known manufacturer.

Labels are usually used like this:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node:Label) RETURN node

MATCH (node:Label) WHERE node.property = "value" RETURN node

MATCH (node1:Label1)-[:REL_TYPE]->(node2:Label2)
RETURN node1, node2
----

== Practical Example

Let's try out what we've learned.

=== Create a Record for Yourself

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (you:Person {name:"You"})
RETURN you
----

`Create` creates nodes with labels and properties.

// graph

You like the NoSQL, Graph Database _Neo4j_, right?

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH  (you:Person {name:"You"})
CREATE (you)-[like:LIKE]->(neo:Database:NoSql:Graph {name:"Neo4j" })
RETURN you,like,neo
----

`Create` can create single nodes, or more complex structures in one go.

// graph

=== Create Your Friends

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you:Person {name:"You"})
FOREACH (name in ["Johan","Rajesh","Anna","Julia","Andrew"] |
  CREATE (you)-[:FRIEND]->(:Person {name:name}))
----

`Foreach` allows you to execute operations for each element of a list.

// graph

=== Find Your Friends

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you {name:"You"})-[:FRIEND]->(yourFriends)
RETURN you, yourFriends
----

// graph_result

// table

=== Create Second Degree Friends and Expertise

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (neo:Database {name:"Neo4j"})
MATCH (anna:Person {name:"Anna"})
CREATE (anna)-[:FRIEND]->(:Person:Expert {name:"Amanda"})-[:WORKED_WITH]->(neo)
----

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (neo:Database {name:"Neo4j"})
MATCH (johan:Person {name:"Johan"})
CREATE (johan)-[:FRIEND]->(:Person:Expert {name:"Max"})-[:WORKED_WITH]->(neo)
----

// graph

=== Find Someone Who Can Help You Learn Neo4j

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you {name:"You"}), (expert)-[:WORKED_WITH]->(db:Database {name:"Neo4j"}),
  p = shortestPath( (you)-[:FRIEND*..5]-(expert) )
RETURN p,db
----

// graph_result

// table
