=== Neo4j for PHP Developers

image::http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/neo4j-loves-php.png[]

You're a PHP developer and want to start with Neo4j?
You're in the right place!

Whether you're using frameworks like Symfony and Laravel or you're developing without frameworks, you'll find an adequate library for your use case.

// end::intro[]

If you have any questions, you can always find a community member around on Twitter or StackOverflow by tagging your subjects with #neo4j-php.


Members of the PHP community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them, provide feedback to the authors.

=== Using Neo4j in a standalone PHP environment

If you prefer to develop without frameworks, these libraries are made for you:

=== NeoClient

NeoClient is a powerful and flexible PHP Client for Neo4j with MultiDB support, and full High-Availability support for Neo4j Enterprise, and a convenient object formatter for handling graph results.
It is built on top of the Symfony components, which makes integrating it in a modern PHP framework very easy.
The 2.0 stable release has been announced end of November 14, with the following changes and improvements:

- Everything is built as an extension, meaning the core commands are an extension to the library, which makes the library very flexible and customizable.
- All commands are registered as lazy services, improving the library performance.
- The Service Container can be cached, gaining up to 300% performance when runnning in production.
- Full High-Availability support, with master re-election detection, slaves fallback built-in mechanism, and convenience methods for directing write and read queries to different databases.
- Minimalistic HA mechanism when running Neo4j Community Edition
- Full-fledged Response Graph format
- Enterprise support by http://graphaware.com[GraphAware]

=== Neo4jPHP

Neo4jPHP provides an API that is both intuitive and flexible, and it takes advantage of ‘under-the-hood’ performance enhancements, such as caching and lazy-loading.

=== Other Drivers

==== neo4j-pdo


This is a PHP Data Objects driver for the Neo4j graph database, it allows you to connect to a Neo4j server from PHP using the standard PDO API.
The project currently only implements a “vanilla” PHP implementation, which means you need to use a special constructor to create your PDO connection.
PHP extensions to register the driver with PDO in HHVM and Zend VM are planned future work.
