=== Neo4j for Java Developers

image::http://assets.neo4j.org/img/languages/java.jpg[]

Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for Java or JVM-language developers.

There are two ways of using Neo4j from the JVM.
The standalone Neo4j Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its HTTP API.
You can use any REST library you choose for any JVM language.
The dedicated Neo4j drivers go beyond that by offering comprehensive APIs for integrating with graph-based applications.
// end::intro[]

But you can also run {manual}/tutorials-java-embedded.html[Neo4j embedded in your JVM process], much like HSQL or Derby.
This is great for unit testing, but also for high performance / no-network setups.
If you use Neo4j embedded, you can use the Neo4j Core-Java-API directly.
Besides an object-oriented approach to the graph database, working with Nodes, Relationships, and Paths, it also offers highly customizable high-speed traversal- and graph-algorithm implementations.
You can also choose from any useful drivers wrapping that API, which exist either for specific programming languages or that add interesting functionality.

One example is link:../spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j], which integrates tightly with the http://spring.io/[SpringFramework] and offers Object-Graph mapping on top of Neo4j.

As a JVM developer you are also on the bright side when it comes to inserting large amounts of data into Neo4j.
With its non-transactional, low-level batch-insertion API it can ingest millions of nodes and relationships in just seconds.

Follow the guides below to get you started.

[[neo4j-jdbc]]
=== Using Neo4j Server with JDBC

Being a Java developer you're probably familiar with JDBC as a way to work with relational databases, either directly or via abstractions like Spring's `JDBCTemplate` or MyBatis.
Many tools for ETL, Business Intelligence, and data management also use JDBC drivers to interact with relational databases.

As Cypher, like SQL, is a textual parametrizable query language that can return tabular results, it was possible for us to support the JDBC APIs and make a http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j-JDBC] driver available.
More details on how to use it can be found with our example project for {examples}/movies-java-jdbc[Java-JDBC].
There, we implement the backend as a minimal Java webapp that leverages Neo4j-JDBC to connect to Neo4j Server.

[[neo4j-ogm]]
=== Object-Graph-Mapping with Neo4j-OGM

Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping domain object networks to your database.
The Neo4j-OGM library is a pure Java library that can store, read and query (annotated) domain objects using Neo4j.
It uses Cypher statements execute those operations with Neo4j Server.
The OGM supports tracking changes to minimize necessary updates and transitive persistence (reading and updating neighborhoods of an object).

[[server-extension]]
=== Extending Neo4j Server with a Server Extension

A great way of accessing the high performance graph database directly from your Java code is to write a Neo4j Server extension.
Then you get the double benefit of easy deployment and high performance database access.

A Server extension provides a Jersey JAX-RS REST endpoint with a protocol and granularity that you control, you use it to send and receive data structures of your domain.

After declaring the dependencies to Neo4j and Neo4j-Server-APIs you can create REST-resources that are deployed by Jersey at startup.
Within those resources you can get the `GraphDatabaseService` and `ExecutionEngine` injected and use all Java APIs as well as executing Cypher directly.
The path-finding and traversal APIs are also available.

The results of your graph operations are then collected and rendered as the format you want to expose, e.g. JSON, XML, plain text or binary.

The {examples}/movies-java-server-extension[example project] shows how you would do that for our movie application endpoints.

[[jcypher]]
=== JCypher

JCypher provides seamlessly integrated Java access to Neo4j at different levels of abstraction:

At the topmost level of abstraction, JCypher allows you to *map complex business domains* to graph databases.
You can take an arbitrarily complex graph of domain objects or POJOs and store it in a straightforward way into Neo4j for later retrieval. 
You do not need to modify your domain object classes in any way, there is also no need for annotations. 
JCypher provides a default mapping out of the box.

At the same level of abstraction, *Domain Queries* provide the power and expressiveness of queries on a graph database, 
while being formulated on domain objects or on types of domain objects, respectively.
The true power of Domain Queries comes from the fact, that the graph of domain objects is backed by a graph database.

At the next lower level of abstraction – access to graph databases – is provided based on a generic graph model.
While simple, the model allows you to easily navigate and manipulate graphs. 

At the bottom level of abstraction, a *native Java DSL* in the form of a fluent Java API allows you to intuitively and comfortably formulate queries against Neo4j.

=== Testing Neo4j Applications

Depending on the deployment mode, you test your Neo4j backed application differently.

==== Unit Testing

Applications using Neo4j in embedded mode and server extensions can be tested using the in-memory impermanent Graph Database instance.
The Neo4j Manual has a complete section on this topic.

You can obtain an instance of it like this:

[source,java]
----
----

Please make sure that your transactions are all completed (closed after `failure` or `success` calls) and the database is shut down correctly. 
Otherwise you might experience delays (transaction grace period) or leaks while tearing down your tests.

[source,java]
----
ImpermanentGraphDatabase db = new TestGraphDatabaseFactory().newImpermanentDatabase();

// or

ImpermanentGraphDatabase db = new TestGraphDatabaseFactory().newImpermanentDatabaseBuilder()
        .setConfig(...).newGraphDatabase();
----

It also has a `cleanContent()` method which you can run between tests to clean out newly created data.

If you use transaction around your test you can also rollback the transaction at the end to reset the database to its previous state.

==== Testing Server Extensions

Neo4j 2.2 introduces a {manual}/server-unmanaged-extensions-testing.html[new module] that makes it easier to test Neo4j Server and server extensions: `neo4j-harness`.

After adding `org.neo4j.test:neo4j-harness:${neo4j.version}` to your dependency setup you can use both a builder to create Neo4j server instances as well as a JUnit Rule to achieve the same:

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public Neo4jRule server = new Neo4jRule().withExtension("/test", TestResource.class);

@Test public void testWithRule() {
   HTTP.Response response =
           HTTP.withBaseUri(server.httpURI().toString())
               // optional
               .withHeaders("accept", "application/json").GET("test/foo/42");

   assertEquals(200, response.status());
   assertEquals(4711, response.<Map>content().get("value"));
   
}

@Test public void testWithBuilder() {
   try (ServerControls server TestServerBuilder.newInProcessBuilder().withConfig(...)
                                    .withFixture(...).withExtension(...).newServer()) {

      server.httpsUrl() ....
   }
}
----

==== GraphAware Testing Framework

The GraphAware testing framework was developed as part of customer engagements and represents real-world testing experience with Neo4j.

It supports setup fixtures, database comparisions and testing of both Neo4j Server as well as embedded APIs.

// TODO MORE

Example:

[source,java]

==== NoSQL-Unit

Alex Soto's http://[NoSQL-Unit] allows testing of various NoSQL databases.

For Neo4j it provides support for testing the embedded mode as well as Spring Data Neo4j.

==== Testing with a real Neo4j Server

If you don't want or can't use the server testing infrastructure mentioned above, 
you can quickly spin up a Neo4j server for testing in a temporary directory.

[NOTE]
Just make sure that you set-up auth before either by disabling it or by pre-seeding the server with a known password by either copying a `data/dbms/auth` file or by calling the "change password endpoint" upfront with the default credentials.

Travis CI (config) and also http://graphenedb.com[GrapheneDB] (API) provide options to provision Neo4j instances programmatically.
