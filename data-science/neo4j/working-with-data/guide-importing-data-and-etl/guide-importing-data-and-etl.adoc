.Goals
[abstract]
This guide explores how to export data from a PostgreSQL database (RDBMS) for import into Neo4j (GraphDB). You'll learn how to take a relational database schema and model it as a graph, for import into Neo4j.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a basic understanding of the link:/developer/get-started/graph-database#property-graph[property graph model] and have completed the link:/developer/data-modeling/guide-data-modeling[modeling guide].
If you link:/download[download] and install the Neo4j server you'll be able to follow along with the examples.

=== NorthWind Introduction

In this guide we'll be using the link:https://code.google.com/p/northwindextended/downloads/detail?name=northwind.postgre.sql&can=2&q=[NorthWind dataset], a commonly used SQL dataset.
Although the NorthWind dataset is often used to demonstrate SQL and relational databases, it is graphy enough to be interesting for us.

The following is an entity relationship diagram of the NorthWind dataset:

=== Developing a Graph Model

When deriving a graph model from a relational model, we should keep the following guidelines in mind:

* A _row_ is a _node_
* A _table name_ is a _label name_

In this dataset, the following graph model serves as a first iteration:

==== How does the Graph Model Differ from the Relational Model?

* There are no nulls.
** In the relational version, to track the employee hierarchy we have a null entry in the 'ReportsTo' column if they don't report to anybody. In the graph version we just don't define a relationship.
** Non existing value entries (properties) are just not present.
* It describes the relationships in more detail. For example, we know that an employee SOLD an order rather than having a foreign key relationship between the Orders and Employees tables. We could also choose to add more metadata about that relationship should we wish.
* It will often be more normalised. For example, addresses have been denormalised in several of the tables but in a future version of the graph model we might choose to make addresses nodes in their own rights. 

=== Exporting the Data to CSV

Now that we know what we'd like our graph to look like, we need to extract the data from PostgreSQL so we can create it as a graph.
The easiest way to do that is to export the appropriate tables in CSV format. 
The PostgreSQL 'copy' command lets us execute a SQL query and write the result to a CSV file, e.g. with `psql -d northwind < export_csv.sql`:

.export_csv.sql
[source, sql]
----
include::{northwind}/export_csv.sql[]
----

=== Importing the Data using Cypher

After we've exported our data from PostgreSQL, we'll use Cypher's link:{manual}/query-load-csv.html[LOAD CSV] command to transform the contents of the CSV file into a graph structure.

First, create the nodes:

.import_csv.cypher
[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=nodes]
----

Next, we'll create indexes on the just-created nodes to ensure their quick lookup when creating relationships in the next step.

[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=indexes]
----

Initial nodes and indices in place, we can now create relationships of orders to products and employees:

[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=rels_orders]
----

Next, create relationships between products, suppliers, and categories:

[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=rels_products]
----

Finally we'll create the 'REPORTS_TO' relationship between employees to represent the reporting structure:

[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=rels_employees]
----

For completeness and optimal query speed, create an unique constraint on orders:

[source, cypher]
----
include::{northwind}/import_csv.cypher[tags=constraints]
----

You can also run the whole script at once using `bin/neo4j-shell -path northwind.db -file import_csv.cypher`.

The resulting graph should look like this:

image::http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/northwind_graph_sample.png[]

We can now query the resulting graph.

=== Querying the Graph

One question we might be interested in is:

==== Which Employee had the Highest Cross-Selling Count of 'Chocolade' and Which Product?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (choc:Product {productName:'Chocolade'})<-[:PRODUCT]-(:Order)<-[:SOLD]-(employee),
      (employee)-[:SOLD]->(o2)-[:PRODUCT]->(other:Product)
RETURN employee.employeeID, other.productName, count(distinct o2) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

Looks like employee #1 was very busy!

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
employee.employeeId,other.productName,count
1,Pavlova,56
1,Camembert Pierrot,56
1,Ikura,55
1,Chang,47
1,Pâté chinois,45
|===

We might also like to answer the following question:

==== How are Employees Organized? Who Reports to Whom?

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (e:Employee)<-[:REPORTS_TO]-(sub)
RETURN e.employeeID AS manager, sub.employeeID AS employee;
----

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
manager,employee
2,1
2,3
2,4
2,5
2,8
5,6
5,7
5,9
|===

Notice that employee #5 has people reporting to them but also reports to employee #2.

Let's investigate that a bit more:

==== Which Employees Report to Each Other Indirectly?

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path = (e:Employee)<-[:REPORTS_TO*]-(sub)
WITH e, sub, [person in NODES(path) | person.employeeID][1..-1] AS path
RETURN e.employeeID AS manager, sub.employeeID AS employee, CASE WHEN LENGTH(path) = 0 THEN "Direct Report" ELSE path END AS via
ORDER BY LENGTH(path);
----

[format="dsv", options="header"]
|===
e.EmployeeID:sub.EmployeeID:via
2:1:Direct Report
2:3:Direct Report
2:4:Direct Report
2:5:Direct Report
2:8:Direct Report
5:6:Direct Report
5:7:Direct Report
5:9:Direct Report
2:6:[5]
2:7:[5]
2:9:[5]
|===

==== How Many Orders were Made by Each Part of the Hierarchy?

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (e:Employee)
OPTIONAL MATCH (e)<-[:REPORTS_TO*0..]-(sub)-[:SOLD]->(order)
RETURN e.employeeID, [x IN COLLECT(DISTINCT sub.employeeID) WHERE x <> e.employeeID] AS reports, COUNT(distinct order) AS totalOrders
ORDER BY totalOrders DESC;
----

[format="dsv", options="header"]
|===
e.EmployeeID:reports:totalOrders
2:[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,8]:2155
5:[6,7,9]:568
4:[]:420
1:[]:345
3:[]:321
8:[]:260
7:[]:176
6:[]:168
9:[]:107
