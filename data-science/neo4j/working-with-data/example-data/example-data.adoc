.Goals
[abstract]
There's lots of example datasets for Neo4j.
This guide outlines some of them.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be comfortable installing and importing data into Neo4j.

=== Importing Data Sets

The Zip files in the following section contain the contents of a Neo4j graph.db directory. To use them:

* Stop your Neo4j server
* Extract the file into `/path/to/neo/data/graph.db`
* Start the server again
* Open the Neo4j Web Interface
* Read about the Cypher Query Language
* Follow the source links for some example Cypher queries
* All data sets are compatible with Neo4j version 1.6 and later

You can also point the neo4j-shell to the extracted directory to run Cypher queries directly:
[source, shell]
----
/path/to/neo/bin/neo4j-shell -path /path/to/graph.db
----

// TODO CSV Datasets !!

=== Neo4j Graph Gists

http://graphgist.neo4j.com[Neo4j Graph Gists] are a great source for datasets to get started, as they not only come with the example data setup, but also

////
=== Graph Generators

* [LDBC Large Dataset Generator]
////

=== Public Datasets with Instructions

These are not prebuilt data-stores but raw data (mostly CSV) to be imported.
The on the linked articles and repositories, the loading instructions are listed along with raw data sources.

Have fun, and send us https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/developer-resources/issues[feedback] if something doesn't work.
