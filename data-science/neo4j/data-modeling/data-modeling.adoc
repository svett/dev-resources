These guides and tutorials are designed to provide you with the confidence to build graph-based applications with rich data models.
The focus of this section is to provide you the necessary good practices and guidelines to help you model your domain as a graph.

Topics include:

* Data Modeling Guidelines
* Translating a RDBMS Schema to Graph
* Optimizing Data Models for Performance
* Optimizing Data Models for Queryability

Developing, documenting and sharing your graph models is easy.
Just create a simple text file containing prose, pictures and cypher queries and render them into live graph model documents.
Explore the many examples the Neo4j user community created.
