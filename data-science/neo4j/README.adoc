== Neo4j Developer Resources

This is the repository with the source content for the http://neo4j.com _developer resources_ section.

The content is written as textual format in http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc] rendered with asciidoctor using templates to HTML and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch or to wordpress.

Install asciidoctor (1.5.1) ruby gems with `bundle install` in the main directory.

You can render a single document to its `index.html` by calling `./render.sh path/to/doc.adoc` +
(e.g. `./render.sh in-production/guide-cloud-deployment/guide-cloud-deployment.adoc`) or render all pages at once with just `./render.sh`

You can open the generated `index.html` file locally to check the rendering/preview, or start the `http` script in the main directory, and then open: http://localhost:8000/developer-resources/

After commiting changes to head, you can push them to the publish branch: `git push origin HEAD:publish`.  This will cause https://snap-ci.com/neo4j-contrib/developer-resources/branch/publish[Snap CI] to push the changes to the web server.

=== Guides

Most of the documents in this developer resources section are organized as a guide. 
Those guides come with a consistent structure and similar use of language and assets. 
Each of the guides lives in its own directory and is rendered into an `index.html` file for publication.
You can run the rendering process by calling `render.sh` on the command line.

A guide has this general structure:

1. goal for this guide
2. prerequisite with links to relevant sections
3. recommended experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
4. Multiple sections and subsections outlining the content
use a welcoming and helpful, not overly complex or eloquent language with examples in code, pictures or videos
5. each top level (`===`) section can be followed by a sidebar section which will be rendered on the right side with links to follow up information (internal links, calls to action, external links)

Please see the link:./guide_template.adoc[example guide template file] for a blueprint of the document structure needed.
And as link:./guide_template.html[rendered document].

=== Example Applications per Language, Stack and Driver

To explain how to use Neo4j with different programming languages we provide an intro section per language, located in `language-guides/<language>/<language>.adoc`.

To show how the different drivers for that language would be used/integrated we also provide small example projects/setups in the `language-guides/<language>/<driver>` directories.

The example application is a simple, single-page movies app based on the Neo4j-Movies dataset that comes with the Neo4j-Server (`:play movies` in the Neo4j-Browser).

See an example running http://my-neo4j-movies-app.herokuapp.com/[here on Heroku].

The HTML page uses jQuery ajax requests to query 3 REST-Endpoints in the backend for `/search`, `/movie` and `/graph`

* `/search` lists the movies found by title
* `/movie` returns details for a single movie
* `/graph` renders the full graph as a basic d3-visualization

This is our current list of projects:

* java/jdbc
* java/server-extension
* python/py2neo (Thanks Nigel & Mark)
* python/neo4j-rest-client (Thanks Javier)
* clojure/neocons (Thanks Rohit)
