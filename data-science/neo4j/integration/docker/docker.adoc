.Goals
[abstract]
This overview demonstrates several ways of utilizing Docker containers to run Neo4j instances or integrate them into a bigger setup. Detailed instructions are available at the linked repositories, which we don't want to duplicate here.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a sound understanding of both Docker and Neo4j, to leverage them effectively together.

== General Observations

http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on a host operating system.
Docker images are pre-build in layers from configuration of services one of which would be Neo.
They are built using a simple textual description (`Dockerfile`) that describes one layer.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, no time-consuming operating system boot required.

There are many ways to leverage Docker for your Neo4j deployment.

You can create throwaway Neo4j instances of many different versions for testing and running your applications.
You can pre-seed containers with datasets and configurations.

Conflicting port and disk usage can be handled by mapping ports and volumes of multiple instances of the same container to different on the host system.
Docker containers can be used as infrastructure layer, data containers or configuration providers.

== The "Neo4j" Docker Image (beta)

This documents the _beta_ https://hub.docker.com/r/neo4j/neo4j/[Neo4j - Docker image], released after getting many requests for it from our users and customers.
It is in _beta_ state, because it doesn't yet come with guarantees, official customer support and has not been as battle tested as the rest of our product packaging.

We make the recent versions available on Docker-Hub but you can also build it on your own from our GitHub Repository.

=== Run it

----
# interactive with terminal
docker run -i -t --rm --name neo4j -v $HOME/neo4j-data:/data -p 8474:7474 neo4j/neo4j

# as daemon running in the background
docker run -d --name neo4j -v $HOME/neo4j-data:/data -p 8474:7474 neo4j/neo4j
----

The data-directory, containing the store-files, logs, auth etc. resides on your host system outside of the image.
It can be just any empty directory or a (copy of a) data directory of a (not-running) Neo4j-server. 
You can mount it with the `-v` option.

Access then http://localhost:8474 (or whatever port you exposed) on your machine to use Neo4j.

[NOTE]
On OSX, you have to use http://boot2docker.io/[boot2docker] and make the bootdocker environment variables available in your current shell session to have Docker connect correctly to the virtual machine.
For accessing Neo4j you have to use the IP of the `$DOCKERHOST` environment variable.

[NOTE]
On Microsoft Windows, you have to use http://boot2docker.io/[boot2docker]. You'll need to run `boot2docker` as an Administrator, or grant specific permissions in order for a symbolic link to be created on the filesystem.  See http://serverfault.com/questions/476610/virtualbox-issue-with-symlinks-in-shared-folders[serverfault post].
For accessing Neo4j you have to use the IP of the `$DOCKERHOST` environment variable.

There are several tags available:

[cols="1m,4n"]
|===
| 2.2.3 | Neo4j Community 2.2.3 Stable Version
| 2.3-M02 | Neo4j Community 2.3-M02 Milestone Preview
| latest | latest stable version (now 2.2.3) (master)
|===

These are built from the appropriate branches of the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/docker-neo4j[GitHub Repository].

There are also other branches, e.g. for creating Docker images on RedHat Enterprise Linux, which will be covered separately.

=== Implementation

The implementation is pretty straightforward, you can follow it in the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/docker-neo4j/blob/master/Dockerfile[`Dockerfile on GitHub`]

* based on ubuntu + java8 image
* download and extract the correct Neo4j community version to `/var/lib/neo4j`
* mount `/data` directory within volume
* update some configuration values (enable shell, set max tx-log-file size, data directory, fix RRD issue) 
* expose ports `7474` and `7473` for http(s) and `1337` and `1099` for neo4j-shell
* add and run a start script named `neo4j.sh` 
* the start script sets some runtime configuration parameters
* links the `/data` directory to `/var/lib/neo4j/data`
* optionally disables auth
* starts Neo4j in console mode

=== Building the Image

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/docker-neo4j
cd docker-neo4j
docker build .

# note the resulting *image-id*
# name your image with `--name`
# run the image, `-i -t` stand for interactive and terminal so you can stop the server with ctrl-c
# `--rm` deletes the image instance after it has stopped
# pass in the path to an existing neo4j `data` directory or just an empty directory
# `-d` would run it in detached daemon mode, which is the opposite of `-i -t`

# docker run -i -t --rm --name neo4j -v </path/to/neo4j/data-dir>:/data -p <external port>:7474 <image-id>
# for example:

docker run -i -t --rm --name neo4j -v $HOME/neo4j-data:/data -p 8474:7474 <image-id>
----

Open this URL `http://localhost:8474`  in your browser.

On OSX use http://boot2docker.io/[boot2docker] and replace localhost with the IP from `$DOCKERHOST` instead.

=== Authentication

Please note that Neo4j 2.2.x requires authentication.
You have to login with `neo4j/neo4j` at the first connection and set a new password.
Or use the appropriate http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-security.html#rest-api-security-user-status-and-password-changing[REST endpoint] to configure the initial password.
The auth credentials are stored in the `data/dbms/auth` file, which will reside in your external, mounted `data` directory.

You can also access the Neo4j log-files in `data/log` and `data/graph.db/messages.log`

If you set an environment variable `NEO4J_NO_AUTH` to a non-empty value, Neo4j's authentication will be disabled when the Neo4j server in the image is started.

Have fun with the Docker Image and please provide us feedback, via https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/docker-neo4j/issues[GitHub issues], http://twitter.com/neo4j[Twitter] or by mailto:feedback@neotechnology.com[dropping us an email].

[[contributed-containers]]
== Contributed Neo4j Containers

In the Neo4j community and ecosystem a number of containers for Neo4j have been developed, both for running individual instances, for setting up Neo4j Enterprise clusters easily and for providing integration with other tools and services.
Here we want to list some of those examples to either be used directly or as inspiration for your own needs.

It is easy to create a Neo4j image yourself, just any base linux container with a JDK is good enough.
Just add Neo4j (e.g. the debian package) on top and you're done. 

There are already a number of https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=neo4j[Docker Neo4j images] available on Docker Hub.

Make sure when running the docker image to expose the Neo4j port `7474` and provide the database directory as external volume. E.g.

`docker run -i -t -d â€“privileged -v /home/user/neo4jdata:/var/lib/neo4j/data -p 7474:7474 tpires/neo4j`

Some of the more widely used images:

* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/tpires/neo4j/[Neo4j 2.1.x by tpires]
* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kbastani/docker-neo4j/[latest Neo4j by Kenny Bastani]

== Neo4j Enterprise Cluster

Our partner Ekino developed a container setup and script that allows you to spin up a Neo4j enterprise cluster quickly just with a bit of config and a single command line call, if you are on linux :

[source,shell]
----
# start a neo4j cluster w/ 3 nodes
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekino/docker-neo4j-cluster/master/helper.sh | bash -s run:neomaster,neoreadslave,neobackup
----

The latest version is available in ekino's https://github.com/ekino/docker-neo4j-cluster[GitHub repository].
Please see the project documentation for more details.

== Neo4j - Spark - Analytics

As part of the link:../apache-spark#mazerunner[Apache Spark integration] for Neo4j-Mazerunner a default setup is provided by Kenny Bastani to install Spark, Hadoop, RabbitMQ and Neo4j with the Mazerunner extension using Docker.
