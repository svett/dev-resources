Resources
=========

Personal dump of resources. I've had a lot of fun these past two years, and through that I've had a lot of time to learn and think. Here is my personal collection of resources, ranging from engineering, to programming, and scholarships.

### Checking for Broken Links

To check for invalid links, run `./checklinks.py`. This will then provide a list of files, and the URLs that *may* be invalid. Note that there may be false positives - please double check any reported URLs before removing them!

Note: while testing, the script ran for ~100s, but depending on connection speed YMMV. Please bear with it.

You will need `python2` and `git` to run this script, as well as the python packages `python2-termcolor`, `python2-regex` and `python2-pycurl`, which can be installed via `pip install termcolor regex pycurl`.
