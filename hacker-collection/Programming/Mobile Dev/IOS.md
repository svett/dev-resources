Getting Started with IOS
=========================
**What is iOS?** _iOS is the world's most advanced mobile operating system, continually redefining what people can do with a mobile device. Together, the iOS SDK and Xcode IDE make it easy for developers to create revolutionary mobile apps._ - Apple

1. Xcode is the tool we use to develop apps. They are written in Objective-C and recently a new language introduced back in June called [Swift.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

2. Sketch is a mockup tool that I and many startups like Foursquare and Medium use. It's really easy to get started and it has a ton of inbuilt tools for mocking up your apps. [Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch-3/id852320343?mt=12)

3. If you want to go from an idea in your head to getting an app on the app store, this book: [Beginning iOS 7 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-iOS-Development-Exploring-SDK/dp/143026022X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=undefined&sr=8-4&keywords=iOS+development) is one of the best things out there. It will run you through the process of getting your app into people's hands. 

4. A great online tutorial for free (usually 500$) is being provided by BitFountain, using this [Link](http://bitfountain.io/course/the-complete-ios-7-course-learn-by-building-14-apps/?couponCode=COUPON111677) , they also have an iOS 8 course.

5. Stanford University has published all their CS193p Lectures online. If you've done programming before, but not Objective-C, these lectures are a great thing to do. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXY2EbfAreE&list=PLBcBXZRCvzo2pnU0DVMjaZQfob3JYiQhf)

6. A tool called Git is what most major companies use to Version Control their apps. Tools like git allow teams to collaborate on projects and review code more easily. Github.com more specifically is "social coding." It lets you store your code in repositories so other people can build and learn from your code. https://github.com/kylry

7. To see sample projects, [Coco Controls](https://www.cocoacontrols.com) is a library of very high quality sample projects. If you ever want to reverse engineer what other people do, take their sample projects and hack around with them.

8. If you need a backend for your app but don't have experience, a tool called [parse](https://www.parse.com) allows you to easily integrate a backend with your app so you can focus on the client-side. It handles login, signup and data storage. It's pretty awesome.

## Objective-C
- [Ry's Objective-C Tutorial] (http://rypress.com/tutorials/objective-c/index) Good place to learn more about the various aspects of Objective-C language.

## Swift
- [Program in Swift, w/o a Mac](http://swiftstub.com/)
- [The swift blog via Apple](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=1)
