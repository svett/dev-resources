Getting Started With Android Dev
=================================
 **What is Android?**
Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest installed base of any mobile platform and growing fast.

> **Note:** You can find more about Android Development on their [website](http://developer.android.com) from the SDK to design and distribution guidelines.

#### Simple Links
  * [Developer Training with various builds](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html)
  * [UML for developing an app](http://developer.android.com/tools/workflow/index.html)
  * [Android Developer Blog](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/)

#### What to use to create the apps
* [Eclipse IDE + ADT Plugin](http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r23.0.2-windows.exe): If you already use the Eclipse IDE, this is a plugin which can be downloaded for **Windows** and can be used to create android apps. 
**Verdict: Pretty Slow**
* [Eclipse ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#win-bundle):  It includes the essential Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app development.
**Verdict: Slow**
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html): Android Studio is a new Android development environment based on IntelliJ IDEA. **Verdict: Beta but Efficient**

> **What are you creating?**: Essentially you are coding in [Java](https://github.com/HackerCollective/resources/blob/gh-pages/Programming/java.md "Hacker Collective Resource Page") which then gets published into a package. This package is called an APK file, which is a compression format similar to JAR and ZIP.

There are three steps for the perfect app: **[Design](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html "Android Dev. Design Home")** --> **[Develop](http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html  "Android Dev. Develop Home")** --> **[Distribute](http://developer.android.com/distribute/index.html  "Android Dev. Distribute Home")**

Design
-----------

1. [Android Dev. Creative Vision](http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/creative-vision.html): This contains the creative vision for developing android apps, a quick glance would help non-designers or new designers get an idea as to how to plan the design.
2. [Design Principles](http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html): Similar to the above it helps new designers get an idea as to how to plan the design and how to go about actually doing it.
3. [Measurement Cheat Sheet - I](http://www.doubleencore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Android-Design-Cheat-Sheet-highres.png): A simple relational guide for sizes of various design aspects for different screen sizes and pixel densities.
4. [Measurement Cheat Sheet - II](http://petrnohejl.github.io/Android-Cheatsheet-For-Graphic-Designers/): A complex guide, similar to the one above, with easier reading, naming conventions as well as UI Design and Icon Templates.
5. [Android Dev. Design Presets](http://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html): Materials provided by the Android Design team, which can be used without restriction. It includes Photoshop Stencils, Illustrator tool kits, Icon Kit and Color Swatches. 
6. [Design UI Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MOeVNbh9cY): A discussion how the team applied ""Pulse Studies"" (iterative research sessions) in order to put new ideas, designs, and concepts in front of users on a regular basis; it requires minimal advance planning, it can have an immediate product impact, and it can meet urgent needs.

Develop
---------

1. [API Guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html): A guide provided by Google for the entire Android flavor for control over various hardware on the devices + best practices.
2. [Developement Cheat Sheet - I](http://treehouse-cheatsheets.s3.amazonaws.com/android_island1_cheat_sheet.html): A cheat sheet provided by Tree House. Slightly complicated. Good for reference after designing the first few apps.
3. [Development Cheat Sheet - II](http://intelfinity.com/Android Dev CHeat Sheet.pdf): Code Gems Cheat Sheet with definitions for each section of Android Development
4. [Google Services](http://developer.android.com/google/index.html): A list of Google Services which could be used for the apps and how to use them
5. [Samples](http://developer.android.com/samples/index.html): Samples for developed apps with different components from Background Apps to UI-based apps

Distribution
--------------

1. [Upload your app to Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/): So the most important part of distribution is uploading the app to the Play Store. There is a $25 fee. (If you do not want to upload it on play, simply publish it, and distribute the apk)
2. [Distrbution Essentials](http://developer.android.com/distribute/essentials/index.html): A focus on quality should be part of your entire app delivery process: from initial concept through app and UI design, coding and testing and onto a process of monitoring feedback and making improvement after launch.
3. [Building Buzz](http://developer.android.com/distribute/users/build-buzz.html): Distribution can usually be a piece of cake, but if you want to give it your all
